            <p>Hi i'm Reema. I am a 4th year CDU student studying a double bachlors of Information Technology and Creative Arts and Industries new media design.
            </p>
            <p> My two degrees lead me to have varied interests with my most current focus being on Virtual Reality and AR.</p>
            <p> I am more of a designer and researcher rather than a developer so i know i will find this unit difficult however i am going to give it my best shot.</p>
            <p> My interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Music</li>
                <li> TV shows</li>
                <li>Books</li>
                <li> Art</li>
                <li> Photography (I took the image above)</li>
            </ul>

    <h2> What is a Mobile Application?</h2>
        
        <p>According to Technopedia a mobile application or an App is a type of software designed to run on a mobile device i.e. a smart phone or tablet. It also states Apple inc as being the company that popularised the type of software and tells the reader that apps are generally smaller individual software units with limited functionality. </p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Readwrite.com then tells me there are three different categorise mobile applications can fit into. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Native Apps</li>
            <li> Hybrid Apps</li>
            <li> Web Apps</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Native Apps</b> <br> These are specified applications built for a particular use and they therefore cannot be used on different operating systems. An example of this type of application would be snapchat.</p>

        <br>

        <p><b>Hybrid Apps</b><br> These are a combination of both native and web apps. These applications can be supported across platforms. Think Evernote its beautifully designed and very functional. </p>

        <br>
        
        <p><b> Web-based Apps</b><br> These are applications that need good internet connection to run and require minimum storage compared to native or hybrid apps. Think of Facebook as an example of this.
